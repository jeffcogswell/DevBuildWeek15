JavaScript

Code along - in the web console
	Triple equal vs double-equal
	Similar with not double equal vs not equal
	Truthy stuff -- try !!

Spend a whole hour or session on functions
Code along
	Passing different types to a function; passing different number of parameters 
	to a function -- test it out to see what happens
		function mult(x,y) {
			console.log(x);
			console.log(y);
			return x * y;
		}
	
	Creating a function
	Saving a function in a variable <-- VERY IMPORTANT
	Calling the function saved in a variable
	Then console.log the variable
	Saving it into another variable
	Test equality
	Call both


Running a function automatically by putting () after it
Passing a function into a function
Calling the passed in function
Functions returning a function

----

The DOM

Create an ASP.NET core mvc project
Add a basic HTML page via a View tht has no layout

Open in browser
Inspect
Look at the elements and their attributes

Add some CSS at the top with a style tag
	In the inspector, in the styles, change the style. But don't do this -- we'll revisit shortly
	Don't change the attributes of a style! Bad form.
	
	In the inspector, change the class of one of the elements

Add an ID to each div
	Make IDs unique! The browser won't stop you but it's bad form
	
	document.getElementById("block1")
	Look at results. Float mouse over it. See element highlighted. 
	
	q = ...
	q.innerHTML = "Changed Text"

Add some JavaScript inside a script tag



Add a JavaScript function that adds a class to a DIV

First add alert('hello') to onclick and explain that we're in the confines of the browser

----

Declaring variables without var -- very bad
Storing different types after a variable is created, demo this (string then bool)



@{
    Layout = null;
}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Test</title>
    <style>
        .redbackground {
            background-color: red;
        }
        .bluebackground {
            background-color: blue;
        }
    </style>

    <script>
        function ClickMe() {
            document.getElementById('block1').className = 'bluebackground';
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <div id="block1" class="redbackground">
            <h2>This is a block of <b>HTML</b></h2>
        </div>
        <div id="block2" class="bluebackground">
            <h2>This is another block of <i>HTML</i></h2>
        </div>
        <div id="block3" class="redbackground">
            <h2>And a third block of <b>HTML</b></h2>
        </div>

        <button onclick="alert('hello')">Click Me</button>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

JavaScript Practice

Go to groogle and open up the console. Try each of these, and think carefully about the results before proceeding to the next.

if (0) { console.log('if part') } else { console.log('else part') }


Numbers compared to numbers and strings

3 == 4

3 == 3

3 == "3"

"3" == 3

"3" === 3

0 == ""

0 === ""

Numbers compared to booleans

1 == true

1 === true

2 == true

2 == false

2 === false

0 == false

0 === false

true == "true"

Strings compared to booleans

"" == true

"" == false

"" === false

Things that are truthy

boolean true
number 1

Things that are falsy

boolean false
number 0
empty string ""
